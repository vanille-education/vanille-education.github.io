  <h1>About Vanille Education</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Vanille Education</strong> is an independent, open-access platform designed
    to collect, organize, and showcase the best <strong>free online courses and certifications</strong>
    available worldwide.  
  </p>

  <p>
    The project was created by <strong>Vanille</strong>, combining technology, community,  
    and accessible learning into a single hub. The goal is simple:  
    <em>to make high-quality education reachable for everyone, without barriers.</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide curated lists of free courses from trusted providers.</li>
    <li>Promote accessible, self-paced learning.</li>
    <li>Help students, professionals, and creators develop real skills for real careers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why This Project Exists</h2>
  <p>
    Many platforms hide free certifications, make them hard to find, or bombard
    you with ads. Vanille Education solves that with a clean, simple,  
    and transparent directory that stays updated and community-driven.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're improving your CV, learning tech, or exploring new fields,  
    Vanille Education is built to support your journey.
